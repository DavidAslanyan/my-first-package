# My First NPM Package - `@david_aslanyan/my-first-lib`

Welcome to **My First NPM Package**! This is an experimental project where I created and published my first-ever npm package. The goal of this package is to share a simple, reusable React component, `MyButton`, along with its associated styles. The button component is highly customizable, and this package serves as an introductory step in building, testing, and sharing npm packages with the community.

## Project Overview

The project is a simple npm package that contains a reusable `MyButton` React component. It comes with built-in styles for a basic button design, but the button is customizable via props such as `title` and `onClick`. Additionally, I created this package as an experiment to understand how to create, package, and publish npm packages.

### Key Features:
- **React component**: A simple button component built with React.
- **CSS styling**: Basic styles for the button component.
- **TypeScript support**: Type definitions to enhance development experience.
- **Modular**: The button can be easily imported into any React project and customized as needed.

## Installation

**Install via npm**:
   Run the following command to install the package:
